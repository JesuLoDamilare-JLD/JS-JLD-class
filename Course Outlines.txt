What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming or a scripting language that allows the implementation of features on web pages.

What can JS do?
It can do a lot! Here are some:

It can change the content of HTML elements. See Example 2
function myFunc() {
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Everyone!";
}

It can change the value of attributes. See Example 3
function myFunc() {
	document.getElementById("image").src = "images/star.png"

It can change the styling of HTML elements.
function myFunc() {
	document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "green";
	document.getElementById("demo").style.fontWeight = "bold";

Chapter 3
Writing JavaScript Code

JS codes should be written inside the <script> element.
<script>
	document.write("Hello World!");
</script>

<script> placement: When the <script> is inside the <head>, it loads first before the content of the page.
When its inside the <body>, it loads after the content of the page (HTML elements) loads.
It is a preferred option to place the <script> tag at the bottom of the <body> tag. See example 4.
