Chapter 2

What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming or a scripting language that allows the implementation of features on web pages.

What can JS do?
It can do a lot! Here are some:

It can change the content of HTML elements. See Example 2
function myFunc() {
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Everyone!";
}

It can change the value of attributes. See Example 3
function myFunc() {
	document.getElementById("image").src = "images/star.png"

It can change the styling of HTML elements.
function myFunc() {
	document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "green";
	document.getElementById("demo").style.fontWeight = "bold";
	document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "300%";
	document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block";
}

Quiz
Which language do you use to style HTML elements
JavaScript
HTML
CSS

True or False: JavaScript can change the value of HTML attributes.

True or False: JavaScript can change the content of HTML attributes.

It is a scripting language that lets us implement features on web pages
CSS
JavaScript
HTML

These are the building blocks of web page
CSS properties
HTML elements
JavaScript statements


Chapter 3
Writing JavaScript Code

JS codes should be written inside the <script> element.
<script>
	document.write("Hello World!");
</script>

Internal JavaScript: When the <script> is inside the <head>, it loads first before the content of the page.
When its inside the <body>, it loads after the content of the page (HTML elements) loads.
It is a preferred option to place the <script> tag at the bottom of the <body> tag. See example 4.

External JavaScript: JavaScript can also be placed in external files. 
It uses .js e.g. script.js
See example 5

QUIZ
Can you put the <script> elemebr inside the <body>?
Yes
No

True or False: JavaScript codes can NOT be in external files

Can you put the <script> element inside the <head>?
Yes
No

Which HTML element should you use to write JavaScript codes
<script>
<style>



Chapter 4
JS Displaying Output
There are 4 ways of displaying output:
1. Using Console:
By using consol.log(). See Example 6

2. Using Dialog Boxes
By using the alert() function. See Example 7

3. Writing to HTML Elements
By using the innerHTML property, we can change the content of text of the selected element. 
We can use the document.getElementById() function to select an element. See Example 8

4. Writing to the Browser Window
By using the document.write() function, we can write to the content of the document. 
Note that this should only be used for testing purposes as it will delete all existing HTML in the current page. See Example 9.

QUIZ
Which of the following shows an alert dialog box with a message?
console.log()
alert()
document.write()

Which should you use to change the content of an HTML element?
alert()
innerHTML

Which of the following writes to the browser's window?
document.write()
alert()
console.log()

Which of the following writes to the brower's console?
alert()
console.log()
document.write()



Chapter 5
JS Statements
JS statement may span a single or multiple lines
Example of single line statement: document.getElementById("elem").innerHTML = "Hello World!";

Example of multiple lines statement: document.getElementById("elem").innerHTML = 
"Hello World!";

Grouping JS Statements.
JavaScipt is grouped inside curley bracker called code blocks. It makes statements to be executed together
function myFunc() {
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!"
}

JS Keywords
JS statements usually start with a keyword.
Forexample, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword.
function myFunc() {
	var text = "Hello World!"
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
}

QUIZ
What does a JavaScript program consist of?
element
statements

Does this statement span a single line or multiple lines?
document.getElementById("p").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
single
multiple

Which of the following are used to group JavaScript statements?
square brackets []
curly brackets {}

What is a JavaScript code block?
A group of CSS properties.
A group of JavaScript statements

Does this statement span a single line or multiple lines?
document.getElementById("p").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
multiple
single



Chapter 6
JS Syntax
JS follows a set of rules called syntax

Variable declaration: Values are assigned to variables. In JS, this is called declaring variables. 
To declare a variable, use the var keyword to create it, num as the identifier and then an equal sign = to assign a value. 
The equal sign (=) is called the assignment operator.
var num = 5;
document.write(num);

Naming Identifiers  (variable names)
An identifier shoulf start with a letter, an underscore or a dollar sign
An identifier cannot start with a number
An identifier is case-sensitive
An identifier can only contain letters, digits, underscores and dollar signs
JS reserved keywords (like var, function, if, else, etc.) cannot be used as variable names.

JS is Case-Sensitive: See Example 10

QUIZ
What do you call the set of rules that JS follows?
What are identifiers?
True or False: JavaScript is case-sensitive
Does JS follow a set of rules?
Which keyword should you use to create a variable?
What are variable used for? to hold values
What is the value of the x variable?
var x = 21;
var y = 31;




Chapter 7
JS Comments:
JS comments are used to make programming easier to read and understand
There are two types of comments in JS, the single-line and the multi-line
Single-line comments // OR /* */
Multi-line comments /* */

QUIZ
Can you use comments to disable some codes?
Which should you use to write a comments that span multiple lines?
They can be used to make codes easier to read and understand
True or False: In JS, it is NOT possible to write multiple lines of comments.
